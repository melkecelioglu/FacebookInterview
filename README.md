TECHNICAL INTERVIEW 12 Oct 2021

**can not find assessment questions since I though I had not a chance to move into other stages..

There were two Coding questions while one is mid- other one was quite hard. Could not finish the second one, just I coded Half of the question and interviewer Said time is up. Interviewer was a Great person but she was laughing and texting with someone. She had her internship at Spotify, IBM and Facebook . Right Now works on VR.

It Took 45 total 5 min for self representing 15-15 two Coding questions and list 5 min to ask questions to interviewer. I asker About what ere you doing wher recently Facebook went down, and she Said she was out of the office case it was over 5 pm out of the word sometimes these things can happen.


self-evaulation

Practice more algorithm, data structure questions and Think About time complexity how to make it better.

  Summer 2022 SWE Intern, Americas 21 Nov 2021 Online Assesment Completed 120 min, time was quiet enough accomplished over an hour 5 questions asked 2 mid- 2 easy- 1 hard

the one that is quiet challenging over below as I can remember, coded 80 lines as total. Passed successfully 14/15 tests

Is this a tree? A binary tree is represented as a sequence of parent-child pairs, for example: (A,B) (A,C) (B,G) (C,H) (E,F) (B,D) (C,E) A tree with those edges may be illustrated in many ways. Here are two: The following is a recursive definition for the S-expression of a tree: S-exp(node) = ( node->val (S-exp(node->first_child))(S-exp(node->second_child))), if node != NULL = "", node == NULL where, first_child->val < second_child->val (first_child->val is lexicographically smaller than second_child-> val) This tree can be represented in an S-expression in multiple ways. The lexicographically smallest way of expressing it is as follows: (A(B(D) (G)(CCE(F)) (H))) Translate the node-pair representation into its lexicographically smallest S-expression or report any errors that do not conform to the definition of a binary tree. The list of errors with their codes is as follows: Error Code Type of error More than 2 children Duplicate Edges Cycle present (node is direct descendant of more than one node) Multiple roots Any other error Function Description Complete the function sExpression in the editor below. The function must return either the lexicographically lowest S- expression or the lexicographically lowest error code as a string. sExpression has the following parameter(s): nodes: a string of space-separated parenthetical elements, each of which contains the names of two connected nodes separated by a comma Constraints: 1. All node names are single characters in the range ascii[A-Z] 2. The maximum node count is 26. 3. There is no specific order to the input (parent, child) pairs. Input Format for Custom Testing Sample Case 0 Sample Input 0 (B,D) (D,E) (A,B) (C,F) (E,G) (A,C) Sample Output 0 (A(B(D(E(G)))) (C(F))) Explanation o A representation of the tree is as follows: Explanation o A representation of the tree is as follows: Sample Case 1 Sample Input 1 (A,B) (A,C) (B,D) (D,C). Sample Output 1 E3 Explanation 1 Node C is a child of nodes A and D. Since D tries to attach itself as parent to a node already above it in the tree, this forms a cycle.
